## Requirement
●        Regarding tutors, they can indeed be individuals from various backgrounds, but our primary target is graduates who are looking to earn money and support themselves. These individuals must possess credentials to demonstrate their expertise, including educational qualifications, specialized skills and personal identification information to ensure trust and credibility.

●        When it comes to “students”, the main reason why we do this web app is to help them feel easier in studying with reasonable prices and immediately.

●        Guests: limited access to system features (web app).

●        Student: the person who uses the application to rent a tutor to help them with their study problem. They can search for tutor by name, subject, chat with tutor, leave rating and feedback for tutor after rent (web applications)

●        Tutor: user who uses the app to create their service to support students about the subject. They can create a rental service by hour, upload academic videos to advertisements for their service. (web app)

●        Moderator: a user is responsible for content moderation and complaints on the website.

●        Administrator: a privileged user who can manage the entire system.
